# Product Requirements Document: Time Series RAG for Market Pattern Recognition

## Executive Summary

A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system applied to financial time series data that enables traders and analysts to find historically similar market patterns and analyze their outcomes. This prototype demonstrates how embedding-based similarity search, popularized in LLM applications, can be adapted for quantitative finance and technical analysis.

## Product Vision

### Problem Statement
- Traders lack efficient tools to search through vast historical market data for similar chart patterns
- Manual pattern recognition is time-consuming and prone to cognitive biases
- Existing technical analysis tools are rule-based rather than similarity-based
- Historical pattern analysis is typically limited to single symbols or fixed timeframes

### Solution
A scalable pattern recognition system that:
- Converts price action into searchable embeddings
- Enables cross-symbol and cross-timeframe pattern matching
- Provides statistical analysis of post-pattern outcomes
- Offers interactive visualization for pattern exploration

### Target Users
- Quantitative researchers exploring pattern-based strategies
- Technical analysts seeking historical precedents
- Algorithmic traders developing pattern recognition systems
- Financial institutions building market intelligence tools

## Core Functionality

### 1. Data Ingestion Pipeline
**Purpose**: Automated collection and storage of market data

**Requirements**:
- Fetch OHLCV data from multiple sources (yfinance, CCXT, proprietary feeds)
- Support multiple asset classes (equities, crypto, forex, commodities)
- Handle various timeframes (1min to monthly bars)
- Implement incremental updates for real-time data
- Store raw data in TimescaleDB with proper indexing

**Success Metrics**:
- Data freshness < 1 minute for real-time feeds
- Support for 10,000+ symbols
- Historical data depth of 20+ years where available

### 2. Pattern Embedding Generation
**Purpose**: Transform price patterns into searchable vector representations

**Current Implementation**:
- MinMax normalization of OHLC values within windows
- Configurable window sizes (5-100 bars)
- Overlapping windows with adjustable stride

**Enhancement Opportunities**:
- Autoencoder-based embeddings for complex pattern capture
- Time series foundation models (TimesFM, Chronos)
- Multi-scale embeddings (capture patterns at different resolutions)
- Technical indicator augmentation (RSI, MACD, volume profile)
- Market regime embeddings (trending, ranging, volatile)

### 3. Similarity Search Engine
**Purpose**: Efficient retrieval of similar historical patterns

**Requirements**:
- Vector similarity search using cosine/euclidean distance
- Metadata filtering (date ranges, symbols, market conditions)
- Timeframe-agnostic matching (hourly patterns match daily patterns)
- Adjustable similarity thresholds
- Support for composite queries (multiple pattern conditions)

**Performance Targets**:
- Query response time < 100ms for 1M embeddings
- Precision@10 > 80% for visually similar patterns

### 4. Outcome Analysis System
**Purpose**: Statistical analysis of post-pattern market behavior

**Features**:
- Forward return distributions (1, 5, 10, 20 bars)
- Win rate and risk/reward ratios
- Maximum favorable/adverse excursions
- Pattern completion statistics
- Confidence intervals and statistical significance tests

### 5. Interactive Visualization Interface
**Purpose**: Intuitive exploration and analysis of patterns

**Components**:
- Current market pattern display
- Grid view of similar historical patterns
- Overlayed comparison charts
- Outcome distribution visualizations
- Interactive filtering and parameter adjustment
- Pattern annotation and labeling tools
